# Employee Manager Day 4

 

### /Login Post Route.
Were going to create a service for the login process to handle the authentication of the users email and password using the users.json file.


### Login Service
The login service has to do a couple of tasks. It has to read the user.json file data and match the req.body.email and the req.body.password to the user data. If there are any errors we have to return an error object to the client. If the user email and password are valid credentials then we will redirect the user to the dashboard.html. At a later date we will convert the dashboard.html file into a server side ejs template and render the error messages server side and send the ejs template as the response.

```js
const fs = require('fs');
 function getFileContents = (filePath)=> {
    let fileContents =  fs.readFileSync(filePath) 
    fileContents = JSON.parse(fileContents)
}
```

### Read files with Node.js
There are a couple of ways to read files with node. The easiest way is to readFileSync(). This is a blocking script meaning that everything stops until the file is loaded.
```js
function writeFileContents = (filePath, data )=> {
    let fileContents = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(filePath))
    // assuming data is an object being passed
     fileContents.push(data)
     // convert the object to json
     fileContents = JSON.stringify(fileContents)
     // write file and data
     fs.writeFileSync(fs.readFileSync(filePath), fileContents)
}
```







### EJS Templates
Today we are going to allow submissions from the login form. If the user email validates then we will grant access to the dashboard. Grab a new copy of the data folder from the teams folder. There is a file called users.json. That is the file mimics a database. We will read this file and see if the provided email matches the one in the users.json file.  

To start we are going to install ejs. Make sure that you are in the server folder when you do this.
```
  npm install ejs
```
Now lets configure ejs as the templating engine we are going to use with our project.
```javascript
const ejs = require('ejs')
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, './views'));
```

 #### How to send a server side template file as a response
```javascript
 res.render('dashboard')
```

 #### Sending Data To A Template
```javascript
 res.render('dashboard', {pageTitle:"Dashboard", pageHeading:"DashBoard Template"})
```


- create dashboard page as server side template using ejs.
- create user.json file to save platform users
- create a fileService to read and write files.
- create a login post route to handle the form.
- how to get form data from the body.
- how to send form data from client.
